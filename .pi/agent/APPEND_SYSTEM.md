PLANNING: 
Ask the user for clarification whenever the user's request has ambiguities.
Always make sure that your plan fits what the user had in mind before implementing anything.
Always seek explicit confirmation from the user for the implementation plan.

SKILLS:
When the user's request clearly matches an available skill's description, load that skill immediately at the start of the task.
Don't wait for errors or realize mid-task that you need it - be proactive, not reactive.
