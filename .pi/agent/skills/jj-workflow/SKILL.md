# Jujutsu (jj) Workflow

Jujutsu is a modern version control system that provides a simpler mental model than Git while remaining Git-compatible. This skill covers the core concepts and workflow commands.

## Core Concepts

### Changes vs Commits
- **Change**: A mutable revision identified by a change ID (e.g., `kkmpptxz`). Changes can be modified.
- **Commit**: An immutable snapshot identified by a commit ID (SHA). Once created, commits are permanent.
- The working copy (`@`) is always a change that can be modified freely.

### Working Copy
- The working copy is denoted by `@` and represents your current state.
- `@-` refers to the parent of the working copy.
- Unlike Git, there's no staging area—all changes are automatically tracked.

## Essential Commands

### Viewing State

```bash
jj status          # Show working copy status
jj log             # View commit history
jj diff            # Show uncommitted changes
jj show @          # Show current change details
```

### Creating and Describing Changes

```bash
jj new                           # Create a new empty change on top of @
jj describe -m "feat: message"   # Set commit message for current change
jj new -m "feat: message"        # Create new change with message
```

### Syncing with Remote

```bash
jj tug             # Fetch updates and rebase current change onto latest remote
jj git fetch       # Fetch from remote without rebasing
jj git push        # Push current changes to remote
```

### Modifying History

```bash
jj squash                    # Squash current change into parent
jj squash --into @-          # Explicitly squash into parent
jj split <file> -m "msg"     # Split specific files into their own commit
jj edit <change-id>          # Edit an existing change
```

### Working with Branches

```bash
jj branch create <name>      # Create a branch pointing to @
jj branch set <name>         # Move branch to current change
jj branch list               # List all branches
```

## Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits** format:

- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` — Performance improvement
- `docs:` — Documentation changes
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks
- `test:` — Adding or updating tests

Examples:
```bash
jj describe -m "feat: add user authentication"
jj describe -m "fix: resolve null pointer in parser"
jj describe -m "refactor: extract validation logic"
```

## Common Patterns

### Starting New Work
```bash
jj tug                              # Sync with remote
jj new -m "feat: new feature"       # Start new change
# ... make changes ...
jj new                              # Finalize and start next
```

### Amending Current Change
Make changes directly—all are tracked in `@`. Use `jj describe` to update message.

### Rebasing onto Latest
```bash
jj tug    # Fetch and rebase in one command
```

### Checkpoints
Use checkpoints before risky operations:

```bash
jj new -m "checkpoint: safe state"    # Create checkpoint
jj new -m "trying: experiment"         # Work on risky change
# If needed: jj op log → jj op restore <id>
jj squash -m "feat: final result"      # Squash when done
```

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are recorded as state and resolved later. See [CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md](references/conflict-resolution.md) for:
- Detecting and resolving conflicts
- Manual and automated resolution
- Conflict scenarios (rebase, merge)

## Advanced Workflows

For expanded patterns and complex workflows:
- Bisecting, undoing operations, splitting changes
- Collaboration patterns (review, PRs, merging)
- Testing and experimental workflows

See [PATTERNS.md](references/patterns.md).
